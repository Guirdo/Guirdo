# Hello, there! I'm Seb M√©ndez...

I've finished a computational systems engineering degree, currently looking for a job opportunity as a front-end web developer.

I love to make my ideas come true through programming, because technology makes the way much easier for creating new and useful things for everyone.

With my web development and design knowledge, I've helped local businesses to have a presence on the internet. Since I think technology must be at our service and not the opposite.
