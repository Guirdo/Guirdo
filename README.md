# Hello, there! I'm Seb M√©ndez...

I've finished a computational systems engineering degree, currently looking for a job opportunity as a front-end web developer with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ReactJS and NextJS.

I love to make my ideas come true through programming, because technology makes the way much easier for creating new and useful things for everyone.

With my web development and design knowledge, I've helped local businesses to have a presence on the internet. Since I think technology must be at our service and not the opposite.

## ‚öíÔ∏è My projects

- [MusTalk](https://mustalk.vercel.app/home): A social network where people share their music taste and talk about why they like that song.

- [Imperambiental](https://imperambiental.com): A landing page made by me and a friend for a local business.

- [APOD App](https://apod-app-guirdo.vercel.app/): A front-end app for the Astronomical Picture Of the Day API from NASA.

## ü§ù Projects which I contribute:

- [p5.js-website](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website): I give feedback to the spanish translation contributors, taking care about how english technical words should be translated to spanish.
